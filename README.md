# TubeDownloaderGUI
## Info:

This is a very basic, limited, feature-poor front-end for youtube-dl. It allows for (my) basic needs with a copy/paste workflow familiar to Windows users. 

## Requirements:

Place ffmpeg files and youtube-dl files in \Bin. 

Folder hiearchy should look somewhat like this:

\Bin

\Log

TubeDownloaderGUI.exe
