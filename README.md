# TubeDownloaderGUI
Info:
This is a very basic, limited, feature-poor front-end for youtube-dl. It allows for (my) basic needs with a copy/paste workflow familiar to Windows users. 

Requirements:
youtube-dl.exe and ffmpeg.exe should reside in the same directory as TubeDownloaderGUI.exe. Files are saved to the Desktop.
